          "desc": "<p>Throughout the documentation are indications of a section's\nstability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it\nmatures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so\nproven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at\nall. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous\nand in the process of being redesigned.</p>\n<p>The stability indices are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 0 - Deprecated. The feature may emit warnings. Backward\ncompatibility is not guaranteed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 1 - Experimental. This feature is still under active development\nand subject to non-backward compatible changes or removal in any future\nversion. Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments.\nExperimental features are not subject to the Node.js Semantic Versioning\nmodel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- separator -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stability: 2 - Stable. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem is a high\npriority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caution must be used when making use of <code>Experimental</code> features, particularly\nwithin modules that may be used as dependencies (or dependencies of\ndependencies) within a Node.js application. End users may not be aware that\nexperimental features are being used, and therefore may experience unexpected\nfailures or behavior changes when API modifications occur. To help avoid such\nsurprises, <code>Experimental</code> features may require a command-line flag to\nexplicitly enable them, or may cause a process warning to be emitted.\nBy default, such warnings are printed to <a href=\"process.html#process_process_stderr\"><code>stderr</code></a> and may be handled by\nattaching a listener to the <a href=\"process.html#process_event_warning\"><code>'warning'</code></a> event.</p>"
